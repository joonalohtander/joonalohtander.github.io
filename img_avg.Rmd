## Digitally Averaging Time Magazines Covers From 2021

In this project I will take the average of every Time magazines cover from last year using Python. By taking the average I mean taking the average RGB-values for all the pixels.

This code can be applied to any collection of images. Just be sure to set the correct variables in the following steps to determine, where the images are, what dimensions do you want them to have, and what filetypes they are.

### Resizing images to same dimensions

I assume you have all the images in a subfolder called "time".

First let us import the packages needed for this example.

```{python imports, eval = F}
import cv2, os, PIL
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
```

Then let us set variables needed later. The img_dims -variable is a tubble containing the dimensions you want your images to be resized to.

```{python variables}
img_folder = "/time"
img_dims = (2363,3150)
```

Next let us access all the images and save them to a list. If your files are not .jpeg or .jpg, change the list items.

```{python images, eval = F}
cwd = os.getcwd()
allfiles=os.listdir(cwd + img_folder)
imlist=[filename for filename in allfiles if  filename[-4:] in [".jpg",".jpeg"]]
```

Next, I will define a function for stretching the images to the correct dimensions (img_dims).

```{python stretch, eval = F}
def scretch(image, dim=(2363,3150)):
    img = cv2.imread(image, 1)
    img_scretched = cv2.resize(img, dim)
    return img_scretched
```

And then we can use this function to resize the images to the correct size.

```{python stretching, eval = F}
N=len(imlist)
for im in range(N):
    image = "." + img_folder + "/" + imlist[im]
    w,h=Image.open(image).size
    if (w,h) != img_dims:
        img_scretched = scretch(image, img_dims)
        cv2.imwrite(image, img_scretched)
```

Now we have all the images in the correct size.

### Taking the average RGB-values

First, we can take the width and height of the (resized) images.

```{python dims, eval = F}
w,h= img_dims
```

Then we can create a numpy array of floats to store the average values.

```{python arr, eval = F}
arr = np.zeros((h,w,3), np.float64)
```

Next, let us cast each image as array of floats and divide by number of images to take the average.

```{python avg, eval = F}
for im in imlist:
  image = "." + img_folder + "/" + im
  imarr = np.array(Image.open(image), dtype = np.float64)
  arr = arr + imarr/N
```

Finally, we can round the values and cast as integer. Then we can generate and save the final image.

```{python final, eval = F}
final_img = Image.fromarray(arr,mode="RGB")
final_img.save("FinalImage.png")
```

This is what my final image looks like:
