### Problem

Students address the problem of sustainability and resilience from different regional and national perspectives. **Aging and demographic challenges** pose a key problem in many European countries. In postindustrial regions such as the Ruhr region, Northern Finland and Lodz, the aging problem is aggravated by shrinking populations due to outmigration and scarcity of high-skilled employees. This demographic change has multiple consequences: the regions are not attractive for modern industries with high productivity and innovativeness, tax incomes are low, there is labor shortage in many important industries such as health and care. Furthermore, regions with insufficient supply of young high-skilled workers are vulnerable to external shocks such as weather events caused by climate change. Students’ task is to think about solutions how the regions could cope with the demographic challenges.
