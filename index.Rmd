I am an economics and data enthusiast. I am currently working as a researcher in the University of Oulu in the [GenZ - Economic resilience](https://www.oulu.fi/en/genz-economic-resilience-research-team) research team. My research interests include gig economy, crowdsourcing, and
the resilience of individuals.
