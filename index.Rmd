I am an economics and data enthusiast. I am currently working as a doctoral researcher in the University of Oulu in the [Economic resilience](https://www.oulu.fi/en/research-groups/economic-resilience-econre-research-team) research team. My research interests include behavioral economics, personality, resilience and group decisions.

I offer data science and data analytics consulting to small and medium size organizations, looking to extract insights from their data. I also offer services for gathering and managing data from simple surveys to web scraping and beyond. To learn more, head over to [www.joonasolutions.com](https://www.joonasolutions.com).
